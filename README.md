# deep-learning-challenge

created the AlphabetSoupCharity.ipynb file and worked on the initial model setup.
then made the few other models to try and increase the model accuracy. but the best accuracy achieved was 0.729 %.

also tried to run the correlation matrix on the model but that also didn't helped in increasing the accuracy.
added the coor model to 'Deep_Learning_challenge_correlation' file in resources folder for reference.

Limitations in doing this project was to work on such a big dataset on free version of google collab.
i had ran into runtime errors multiple times because of that.
